Whack-a-Mole

- Bunnies randomly pop out of holes on the screen.

- The player needs to click on the bunnies to score points.

- The game runs for 15 seconds in total.

- If you miss 2 bunnies, the game ends early.

- If you score 10 points or more, you win.



I chose to build this project because I wanted something fun, interactive, and beginner-friendly that would help me practice JavaScript basics such as timers, event listeners, randomization, and DOM manipulation. I chose this game specifically as it reminds me of some of the childhood games.

Next Steps

- Some improvements I plan to add in the future:

- Add difficulty levels where bunnies appear and disappear faster
- Introduce new characters or themes
- Keep track of high scores using localStorage
